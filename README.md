Voicebot is a conversational interface that enables users to interact with a computer system using voice commands. The goal of this project is to develop a Voicebot system that can perform speech-to-text conversion, text-to-speech conversion, chatbot integration, and front-end development.

- Objectives:

To develop a system that can convert speech to text using a speech recognition API or library.

To develop a system that can read out the text input by the user in a natural-sounding voice using a text-to-speech API or library.

To integrate the system with a chatbot to provide a more natural and engaging conversational experience for the user.

To support multiple languages, allowing users to interact with the system in their native language.

To develop a web or mobile front-end interface that provides users with an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the system.
