# Voicebot is a conversational interface that enables users to interact with a computer system using voice commands. The goal of this project is to develop a Voicebot system that can perform speech-to-text conversion, text-to-speech conversion, chatbot integration, and front-end development.

## Objectives:

- To develop a system that can convert speech to text using a speech recognition API or library.
- To develop a system that can read out the text input by the user in a natural-sounding voice using a text-to-speech API or library.
- To integrate the system with a chatbot to provide a more natural and engaging conversational experience for the user.
- To support multiple languages, allowing users to interact with the system in their native language.
- To develop a web or mobile front-end interface that provides users with an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the system.

# Project Scope:

## Creation of Front-end
The front-end will be created using the Flask framework, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will provide an interface for the user to input audio and receive the response in speech.
- Estimated time: 1 week

## Creation of Voice Recognition System
The SpeechRecognition library will be used to recognize the user's audio input and convert it to text. A function will be added to filter background noise and improve the accuracy of voice recognition.
- Estimated time: 2 weeks

## Integration with ChatGPT
The openai library will be used to create a function that calls the ChatGPT API and generates a response for the input text. The generated response will then be used in speech synthesis to be read aloud to the user.
- Estimated time: 2 weeks

## Creation of Speech Synthesis
The pyttsx3 library will be used to synthesize the response in speech for the user. In addition, the gTTS library will be implemented as an alternative to provide a more natural and personalized voice for the user.
- Estimated time: 1 week

### Total Estimated Time: 6 weeks
