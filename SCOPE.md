- Project Scope:

*Creation of Front-end:* The front-end will be created using the Flask framework, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will provide an interface for the user to input audio and receive the response in speech.

Estimated time: 1 week

*Creation of Voice Recognition System:* The SpeechRecognition library will be used to recognize the user's audio input and convert it to text. A function will be added to filter background noise and improve the accuracy of voice recognition.

*Integration with ChatGPT:* The openai library will be used to create a function that calls the ChatGPT API and generates a response for the input text. The generated response will then be used in speech synthesis to be read aloud to the user.

Estimated time: 2 weeks

*Creation of Speech Synthesis:* The pyttsx3 library will be used to synthesize the response in speech for the user. In addition, the gTTS library will be implemented as an alternative to provide a more natural and personalized voice for the user.

Estimated time: 1 week

*Total Estimated Time: 6 weeks*

Note: The estimated time may vary depending on the complexity of the project and the skills of the development team. It is important for the team to test and adjust the system to achieve the best possible results.
